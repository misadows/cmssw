1) Usage of this module is illustrated by BeamSmearingTest.cfg

2) Expected results
Vertex smearing:
Gaussian distributions with variance described by Eq (29) in TOTEM note 2007-005.

Energy smearing:
Xi histogram shall follow normal distribution N(MeanXi, SigmaXi).

Angular smearing:
For y one expects distribution N(0, SigmaThetaY^2), for x N( + Alpha, SigmaThetaX^2). NB, the effect of crossing angle shifts th_x distributions to POSITIVE values for both forward and backward particles. This is a consequence of the definition (in this module) of th_x = p_x / |p|.
